# Agent Vitals Threshold Configuration
#
# This file externalizes all detection thresholds used by the vitals
# loop/stuck detection engine. Changes here are picked up by VitalsConfig
# when loading from YAML (see config.py).
#
# Environment variables override these values when set.

# --- Loop Detection ---
loop_similarity_threshold: 0.8
loop_consecutive_count: 6

# --- Stuck Detection ---
stuck_dm_threshold: 0.15
stuck_cv_threshold: 0.5
burn_rate_multiplier: 3.0

# Token normalization scale factor for models with different tokenization.
# Set < 1.0 for large models that produce more tokens per step (e.g. 0.5 for 120B models).
# Default 1.0 = no scaling (identity for cloud models).
token_scale_factor: 1.0

# Workflow scope for stuck detection.
# Options: research-only | build-only | all | none
workflow_stuck_enabled: research-only

# --- Temporal Hysteresis ---
th_enter_warning: 0.4
th_exit_warning: 0.6
th_enter_critical: 0.2
th_exit_critical: 0.35
